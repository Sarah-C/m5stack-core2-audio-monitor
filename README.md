# M5Stack Core 2 Audio - Arduino IDE Version!
This Fork of the excellent Audio Visualiser by Atomic14/Chris G ( https://hackaday.io/project/178220-m5core-stack2-audio-visualiser ) is a "Download and Upload" single click version of the code for the Arduino. The original compiles via PlatformIO.
Just download the folder, open the AudioMonitor.ino file, and hit "Upload".

I've done no coding - this is merely a reconfiguring of the code files to compile under the Arduino IDE. (Though getting the paths for the subfolders right for Arduino is a complete PITA.)

You can watch a video explainer [here (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwIWpBqa-nM) which goes into a bit more detail on the audio capabilities of the device.

This project is a nice little demo of audio on the M5Stack Core 2 with some simple visualisations.

~~You'll need to use PlatformIO to build the project.

Hopefully, the code should be easy to understand.

If you want to add some more visualisations then please open up a pull request and contribute some code, here: https://github.com/atomic14/m5stack-core2-audio-monitor

And if you'd like to buy me a coffee...
